# Starter

## This is the starter lib fo a Discord Bot!

## How to install

First fork this repo and host it in your [Localhost](https://techterms.com/definition/localhost) or on any other hosting or a own [VPS](https://techterms.com/definition/vps) would help!

## Step-1
First of all after importing or pushing the files and folders type 
```bash
npm install 
```
which will install all the packages required. After that type 
```bash
node index.js
```
Which will start the Bot!

## Adding New Commands

For adding new commands the following format should be followed

```javascript
const { CommandInteraction } = require("discord.js");

module.exports = {
    name: "Ping",
    description: "Test CMD",
    permission: "ADMINISTRATOR",

    /**
     * 
     * @param {CommandInteraction} interaction 
     */
    async execute(interaction) {
        interaction.reply({content: "Pong!"})
    }
}
```

## Adding New Events

For adding new Events the following format should be followed

```javascript
const Ascii = require("ascii-table");
const { Client } = require("discord.js");

module.exports = {
    name: "ready",
    once: true,
    /**
     * 
     * @param {Client} client  
     * @returns 
     */
    execute(client) {
        const Table = new Ascii("Node Connected!").addRow(`Logged in as : RicoCozy#2460`).addRow(`Total-Servers - ${client.guilds.cache.size}`).addRow(`Total-Members - ${client.users.cache.size}`);
        console.log(Table.toString())
}
```
## Adding Database Structures

First of all go to the structures folder.

And in the Schema folder you can make a Database Structure there!

### Example

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const afkSchema = mongoose.Schema({
    Guild: String,
    User: String,
    Reason: String,
    Date: String
})

module.exports = mongoose.model('afkk', afkSchema)
```
##Handlers

We have our custom handelers. Thanks to [LYX](https://www.youtube.com/lyxcode) Who made the handler. this is the older version but i suggest to see his upcomming video for the new Handler!

When the bot starts the handlers outputes this
